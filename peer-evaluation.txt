Project: P05-Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/jtercoli/05-Space-Shooter.git 




What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
	I noticed that my peer's choice of space ship is cool. And the choice of bullet looks cool as well. The surface looks clean 
and well structured. 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
	I would like to use my peer's graphic choice. But it looks very similar to the homework. There is nothing I can apply on my own project.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
	I want to suggest my peer to add more details into the game. For example, peer can add enemies' fight back bullets.
Or we can have enemies moving around the screen. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
	The comments in the program is understandable. But in the bullet moving and space ship moving part, there are missing comments, so I don't 
know what each line should do for the program. Peer can add some comments like when the user click the mouse, the space ship will shoot bullets, etc.
Else, every thing is good.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
	The code is not confusing to me at all. Overall it looks nice.
Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

	Yes, it contains an appropriate LICENSE

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
	For the readme.md, it is better to introduce more about the game and teach what the user should do when they open 
the game. My peer only use 2 sentences to describe the whole game. It is ok, but not well descriptive enough,
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
8.5/10
Peer can add more interesting content to the game such as welcome surface, system and user fighting each other and so on.
